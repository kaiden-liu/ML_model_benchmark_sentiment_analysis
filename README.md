# ML_model_benchmark_sentiment_analysis

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project where we compared the performances of several Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models using the Sentiment140 dataset.

## Project Description

In this project, we explored the field of sentiment analysis, which is a crucial aspect of understanding human language. We utilized various models including BERT, XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. We also experimented with different techniques in data manipulation, stratified sampling, and hyperparameter tuning.

The key finding from this project is that the BERT model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 84%. However, the XGBoost model also achieved a respectable accuracy of 75%, albeit with a significantly reduced computation time.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sentiment140 dataset, which consists of 1.6 million tweets. This dataset was created by Go, Bhayani, and Huang in 2009.
